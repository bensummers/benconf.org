        <h1>About BenConf</h1>
        <h3>A serious technical event</h3>
        <p>BenConf grew out of a <a href="https://twitter.com/bensummers/uk-technical-ben">a list of UK technical people on twitter called Ben</a>, and a <a href="http://bens.me.uk/2012/announcing-ben-conf">not entirely serious blog post</a> about organising a conference for technical people called Ben.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, there are enough silly people in the world that the blog post got read by tens of thousands of people, and the evening sold out within a couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>Even more surprisingly, Ben Chestnut, founder of MailChimp, thought it would be a good idea to <a href="http://bens.me.uk/2012/mailchimp-sponsors-benconf">sponsor the evening</a>.</p>
        <p>Although it started as a joke, it's a <b>Serious Technical Event</b>. There are lots of events which concentrate on a single technology or industry, and it's hard to find somewhere you can talk about lots of different technical things. And you get hungry.</p>
        <p><b>BenConf</b> is the event you've been waiting for: Lots of interesting technical people talking about lots of different technical things, and a proper dinner at the right time.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Notes for speakers</h3>
        
        <p>There are too many fine Bens to fit into one evening. Although we'd love to hear everyone's talks we won't have enough time.</p>
        <p>Even omitting some talks, we have a packed evening, and I'm going to have to be really strict about the timings. Please err on the side of brevity, and definitely no more than 5 minutes. It's probably best to aim for 3 minutes of material, as things tend to take a bit longer when you're speaking in front of a room of people.</p>
        <p>There is a projector, but as this is a pub, you shouldnâ€™t rely on it working. I've popped in to check it works, and it all looks good, if a bit dodgy on the colours. Make sure your slides are high contrast to make sure they come out right.<p>
        <p>Please send me your slides in advance so I can put them all on a single laptop &ndash; send me a URL of a zip file containing PNG files by 14 November at the latest.</p>
